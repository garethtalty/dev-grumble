Welcome to [dev grumble](https://garethtalty.github.com/dev-grumble)!

My name is Gareth - I'm a software engineer from the South West of England.

In my opinion, working as a Software Engineer is one of the most interesting and varied careers you can have. That's not to say it's always plain sailing. But one thing is pretty certain - every day you witness something new, you learn something. And that's what makes it so rewarding. My plan is to start to document some of my learnings, and share some of my thoughts.

Writing isn't something I'm particularly adept at, nor is it something I particularly enjoy. 

"So why are you wasting even more bytes on the interwebs? There is already too much on it!" I hear you. Well, yes. This isn't really for you - it's for me. 

So don't think of this as somewhere you're going to learn something new, you might not. Think of this as my diary, and you're rifling through it like an absolute degenerate. 

Enjoy!
